Kofax is an integrated platform of applications that streamline the transformation of different document types into structured electronic information, ready for delivery into business systems and
processes. Part of the suite includes document review and validation components. It is important to monitor and diagnose how these components are performing on the end users workstation. Kofax
provides their own monitoring solution, but you can get performance metrics by instrumenting this in dynaTrace.
